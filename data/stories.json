            "body": "<p>A Wellington man in a coma in Thailand is now breathing on his own, four days after a serious scooter crash in Phuket.</p> <p>Paul Lupi, known as PJ, was also able to take some whole foods through a tube on Friday.</p> <p>&quot;These are small signs that are good but the key milestone is waking up,&quot; PJ's brother Joe Lupi said.</p> <p>&quot;PJ remains unconscious but is showing an increased level of arm and leg movement. Shining a torch into his eyes is revealing a quick focus response which is a big improvement from yesterday.</p> <p>&quot;They've put some pumpkin soup in him which is another good sign.&quot;</p> <p>The 28-year-old was in Phuket on Monday when he crashed on a scooter, the day before he was scheduled to fly home.</p> <p>Caught without travel insurance, Lupi's family rallied to raise money to get him the best possible hospital care.</p> <p>Father Paul Lupi Sr, brother Mark Lupi, and friend Matt Hodgson found him in a cramped hospital room in Phuket when they flew to his bedside on Monday.</p> <p>His family immediately put up $50,000 of their own money to have Lupi airlifted to&nbsp;Bangkok's Bumrungrad International Hospital to get specialist treatment.</p> <p>Lupi's injuries include head trauma but the initial bleeding on the brain has stopped. His right kidney was ruptured and bleeding and his right eye socket is partially broken.</p> <p>Joe Lupi said his brother's body was battered and bruised.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Bruised tissue to various parts of the body is reaching its dramatic stage with some unusual colours competing with each other..&quot;</p> <p>The Lupi family said they were &quot;staggered&quot; at the huge financial response to PJ's accident.</p> <p>&quot;It is so heartening to be able to plan the best options for his recovery knowing the funding will be there to provide it,&quot; Joe said.&nbsp;</p> <p>A fundraising page, which was set up by Lupi's friends and family on Wednesday to cover his care, was nearing its $150,000 goal on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>More than 1500 people had donated $149,000 by 8pm, and Joe was optimistic the goal would be reached by the weekend.</p> <p>&quot;I think we will [make the goal], and it takes us to the safe zone,&quot; Joe said.</p> <p>It costs $6000 a day to keep Paul in the hospital in Bangkok, plus scans and surgery and the cost to bring him home, his family said.</p> <p>They were also working with about $150,000 of other funds they had raised outside of the fundraiser, through banks and other sources.</p> <p>Mark Lupi posted on the <a href=\"http://givealittle.co.nz/cause/pjlupi\">givealittle page</a>&nbsp;from Bangkok on Friday.</p> <p>&quot;Thanks everybody for your love and donations. You're literally saving PJ's life.&quot;</p> <p>Travel insurance for two weeks in Asia for a New Zealander in his or her 20s is widely available for between $80 and $125.</p> <p>Joe Lupi urged other families on Wednesday to check their travel insurance details.</p> <p>&quot;Parents, family and friends please, please check your loved ones' insurance covers you for travelling offshore, it's a detail that's so easy to overlook.&quot;</p>",

            "body": "<p>Chiefs assistant coach Andrew Strawbridge has been flown back to Hamilton for further treatment for an eye infection that left him in a critical condition in a Samoa hospital earlier this week.</p> <p>Strawbridge arrived at Hamilton Airport via an air ambulance after 6pm on Friday evening, his condition having stabilised sufficiently to be moved from&nbsp;Moto'otua National Hospital in Apia.</p> <p>A Chiefs spokesperson confirmed Strawbridge, 50, became ill on a flight to Apia on Tuesday where he was heading in his role as technical advisor for the Manu Samoa team that were playing the All Blacks on Wednesday.</p> <p>The infection in his right eye deteriorated rapidly and he was admitted to hospital soon after arriving in Samoa. He had been due to leave with the Samoa squad next Monday for the Pacific Nations Cup in the United States and Canada.</p> <p>A panicked All Blacks chairman frantically rang fans looking for blood as Samoan doctors tried to keep Strawbridge stable.</p> <p>West Coast man Ross Wylde, who'd travelled over to watch the historic All Blacks match against Manu Samoa on Wednesday, didn't hesitate to step-up when he got the call.</p> <p>&quot;I was at my hotel when the phone call came through from the hospital, the All Black chairman said look we need blood,&quot; said Wylde.</p> <p>&quot;It was about midnight and if I hadn't been there it would have been a real problem.&quot;</p> <p>The West Coast man was on an All Black supporter's tour and understood he was the only person to donate blood.&nbsp;He told&nbsp;<i>One News</i>&nbsp;that as soon as he knew he would need to give blood, he started drinking coffee and water.</p> <p>&quot;I was just there at the right place at the right time. O negative blood can match anyone else, it's just by chance Andrew and [I have the same blood type],&quot; Wylde said.</p> <p>&nbsp;Strawbridge's condition was still labelled as critical on Friday as he continued to be treated with antibiotics to fight the infection.</p> <p>However, he was now deemed stable enough to travel home.</p> <p>The Moto'otua National Hospital in Apia updated his condition early on Friday, saying Strawbridge was awake and aware of people talking to him.</p> <p>But a mechanical ventilator meant he was unable to speak in response.</p> <p>His wife Laura and sister Susan Strawbridge joined him in Samoa. The family has again expressed gratitude for the care and support shown to Andrew and his family from the medical team at Moto'otua Hospital, the Manu Samoa aiga and the New Zealand rugby community.</p> <p>Laura Strawbridge said: &quot;We are overwhelmed by the support we are continuing to receive in both Samoa and New Zealand. The kindness shown to us, and the offers of support, has been incredible. We want to thank everyone for their much-needed thoughts and kind wishes at this extremely difficult time.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We are touched and overwhelmed by the kindness and alofa shown to us by friends and strangers and the wider rugby community. I would particularly like to thank the wonderful All Blacks supporter, here for the&nbsp;test match, who responded to the call for a donation of Andrew's blood type.</p> <p>&quot;The ICU team at Moto'otua Hospital, our Chiefs rugby family, our Manu Samoa aiga and New Zealand Rugby have shown us open-hearted support at this extremely difficult time.&quot;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Strawbridge's former Waikato team-mate and current Waikato Rugby Union president Steve Gordon said it had been a &quot;hell of a shock for everyone&quot; when they were contacted on Tuesday and told of their mate's dire medical condition in Samoa.</p> <p>&quot;It's pretty frightening when you get the message that the longer he stays alive the better his chances are,&quot; Gordon said.</p> <p>&quot;It really brings home that it was pretty severe and he's still not out of the woods yet, from what we can gather. He's still in pretty fragile stage.&quot;</p> <p>Gordon said they were all wishing Strawbridge the best and hoping he could get back to New Zealand for further treatment as well as the love and support of his family, friends and the rugby community in general.</p> <p>&quot;We just hope he can overcome it and get back to the Straws we all know and love.&quot;</p> <p>Strawbridge has been an assistant coach at the Chiefs since 2012 - when Dave Rennie took over as head coach - and recently signed on for another two seasons.<u></u></p> <p>Prior to that Strawbridge was an assistant coach with the Auckland provincial side, having previously worked as a high school teacher and coached a number of Waikato representative sides.<u></u></p> <p>He was born in Christchurch but grew up in Hamilton and was educated at Hamilton Boys' High School and Waikato University.<u></u></p> <p>As a player he became one of 21 centurions for Waikato, playing a total of 131 games for the province as a goal-kicking outside back from 1983 to 1995.&nbsp;In that time he won both the NPC first division title and the Ranfurly Shield.</p> <p>Samoa Rugby Union acting Chief Executive Faleomavaega Vincent Fepuleai said: &quot;We are all deeply shocked at how quickly this has evolved and we are very concerned for Straws' health. We are now doing everything we can to support him, Laura and their families.&quot;</p> <div> <p><span></span></p> </div>",

Understandably, you don't get a Victoria Cross until you have done something extraordinary.</p> <p>&quot;I suspect Willie wouldn't want that differentiation between himself and someone else who served.&quot;</p> <p>England was funding the boost in annuities to Victoria and George Cross holders through millions of pounds sterling of fines levied from bankers caught breaking financial rules.</p> <p>While New Zealand had not had a similar windfall - which the British Government used to fund many causes - the amounts would not be high as New Zealand currently only had one potential recipient,&nbsp;Moger &nbsp;said.</p> <p>A New Zealand Defence Force spokesman said the gratuity paid in England did not apply to New Zealand recipients.</p> <p>&quot;The New Zealand Warrant is a completely separate Royal Warrant and does not include an annuity provision, as the grounds for this being implemented are not present in New Zealand.&quot;</p> <p>There were two George Cross holders living in New Zealand but they received their crosses in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>A British High Commission spokesman said there was nothing in this week's British announcement that suggested New Zealand's two George Cross holders would not receive the increase.</p> <p>The Victoria Cross is the highest military decoration for armed forces in Commonwealth countries and is awarded for &quot;valour in the face of the enemy&quot;.</p> <p>Only 23 have been awarded to New Zealanders.</p> <p>Apiata - who received his in 2007 for his heroic actions when his troop was attacked in Afghanistan in 2004 - is the only recipient since World War II.</p> <p>The medals are made by Hancocks, London, with metal from cannons used in the Crimean war.</p> <p>According to the Defence Force, before the 1999 introduction of the New Zealand Gallantry and Bravery Awards, the George Cross was the highest gallantry award for civilians and was ranked immediately after the Victoria Cross.</p>",

Since the purchase significant renovations had been carried out on the home and property.</p> <p>Following the split&nbsp;the model's&nbsp;parents issued&nbsp;her estranged husband&nbsp;with a trespass notice and he was not allowed to enter the property.</p> <p>The judgment said&nbsp;the estranged husband&nbsp;was never actually an owner of the property. The house was registered in the names of&nbsp;the model&nbsp;and her parents as trustees of the family's Trust.</p> <p>The ownership was later transferred solely to the&nbsp;Trust.</p> <p>More than a year on from the separation&nbsp;the estranged husband&nbsp;has had his application to access information about the property and the trust declined.</p> <p>The judgment released by Associate Judge Rob Osborne said&nbsp;the estranged husband&nbsp;wanted documents relating to the&nbsp;home, including the deed of nomination, bank and tax records relating to the property, mortgages and other debt, certificate of title, a copy of the authority for the solicitor to act and any instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;the model&nbsp;gave in respect of the purchase.</p> <p>He also applied for documents in relation to the&nbsp;Trust, including the trust deed, trust accounts, all trustee resolutions and beneficiaries.</p> <p>Associate Judge Osborne said&nbsp;the estranged husband&nbsp;said he wanted the documents so he had all the relevant information needed to provide a basis for an application to split up the couple's relationship property.</p> <p>However, the judge said he was not satisfied&nbsp;any further information was&nbsp;needed&nbsp;to form&nbsp;the&nbsp;relationship property claim against&nbsp;the model.</p> <p>It would also be inappropriate to order&nbsp;the model's&nbsp;parents as trustees of the&nbsp;Trust to give&nbsp;him documents about their trust, Associate Judge Osborne said.</p>",

He said he believed Smith had implied the Knights forward had been somewhat to blame for the spinal injury he suffered in a three-man tackle.</p> <p>Grant spoke out in support of Smith late on Thursday, adding his backing to that of NRL chief executive Dave Smith and head of football Todd Greenberg.</p> <p>Grant said he believed the impasse had caused McKinnon to lose some of his backing within the game.</p> <p>&quot;If Alex is happy with where he is, we don't do anything either,&quot; Grant told Fairfax Media. &quot;It's hard to imagine Alex - and be very careful in how you interpret this - Alex has the sympathy and empathy of 100 per cent of the rugby league community.</p> <p>&quot;It's been shown in every way possible during unbelievably tragic circumstances.</p> <p>&quot;But where he is at at the moment, he has lost some of that support.</p> <p>&quot;I don't think that's what he would have wanted.&quot;</p>",

In the South Island snow forced the closure of part of SH94 between Te Anau and Milford Sound.</p> <p><b><i>Do you have more information? Send your newstips, photos and video to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:newstips@stuff.co.nz\">newstips@stuff.co.nz</a></i></b></p> <p>Eastland Network said up to 500 electricity users remained without power at 4pm on Friday after the storm caused overnight blackouts.</p> <p>Some customers faced a night without electricity as extreme weather conditions made it impossible to get line mechanic crews to some areas, &nbsp;general manager Brent Stewart said.</p> <p>&quot;We are working with roading crews to get our faultmen to the lines but \u2026 we just can't get them in to where they need to be,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Despite that, progress had been made and the flow of new fault reports seemed to have slowed.</p> <p>Engineers had found the integrity of the Tuai/Gisborne 110kV line, where the faults had happened, had not been compromised by snow fall.</p> <p>They had been able to fly along half the line during a break in the weather. A Transfield crew on the ground was completing the survey.</p> <p><b>TRAVELLERS TRAPPED</b></p> <p>Some travellers trapped by the overnight snowstorm had to abandon their cars and find emergency accommodation.</p> <p>Lynne Westerby from the Tiniroto Tavern, inland west of Gisborne city, said around 40 people had been caught out by snow in the area.</p> <p>After a truck became stuck on the road some people abandoned their vehicles and walked to the tavern.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We had to put people up on the floor in the bar on mattresses, and we put families with children in the bedrooms,&quot; Westerby said.</p> <p>Other people were put into shearers' quarters and holiday cottages, and some were looked after by local residents.</p> <p>The snow had come down &quot;with a vengeance&quot; after about 3.30pm on Thursday and had been up to about 20cm deep on the ground around the tavern.</p> <p>&quot;The last time we got a dumping like this was about 10 years ago, and I don't think that was as bad as this,&quot; Westerby said.</p> <p>At the tavern, they had managed to get all the unexpected guests fed before the power went out, and they were able to keep cooking because the stove tops used gas.</p> <p>Visitors had kept warm in front of a big fire, &quot;then we got the guitar out and all sang&quot;.</p> <p>About a dozen travellers had an unexpected night at the Matawai Hotel, northwest of Gisborne, after they were stranded by the snow that closed State Highway 2.</p> <p>Some of the trapped vehicles were towed out of trouble by local farmers, hotel owner Essie Langley said.</p> <p>&quot;The roads were shut both ends. We managed to find room for them, and some stayed on the marae as well,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;And one truck driver slept in his cab. He came in for a cup of coffee this morning.&quot;</p> <p>About 15cm of snow was on the ground around the hotel. It normally snowed on the surrounding ranges in winter but it was maybe three or four years since snow had stayed on the ground around the township.</p> <p><b>POWER OUT</b></p> <p>The storm, which included thunder and lightning, cut power overnight in Gisborne, Wairoa and parts of the East Coast.</p> <p>Between 1am and 2am on Friday, tripping high voltage circuits cut power to the whole Gisborne area on several occasions, affecting 20,600 customers.</p> <p>&quot;These trippings resulted in total loss of supply to the Gisborne network on several occasions for up to 15 minutes,&quot;&nbsp;Eastland's Stewart said.</p> <p><b>MT TARANAKI AVALANCHE RISK</b></p> <p>The heavy snow falls of the past few days had created a &quot;considerable&quot; avalanche risk on Mt Taranaki, the New Zealand Avalanche Centre warned.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/70098279/considerable-avalanche-risk-on-mt-taranaki\">Considerable avalanche risk on Mt Taranaki</a></b></p> <p><b>RELIEF ON WAY</b></p> <p>The cold southerly flow spreading wintry showers over central, southern, and eastern parts of the North Island, should move off by late Saturday.</p> <p>&quot;The remainder of the southerly flow is moving off the country today and tomorrow,&quot; MetService meteorologist Ciaran Doolin said.</p> <p>A ridge of high pressure building from the south of the country and moving north would mean light winds, clear skies, and possibly colder overnight temperatures.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;There may be some cool temperatures in sheltered places overnight and tomorrow night.&quot;</p> <p>Another front was developing and could hit the country early next week, bringing more bad weather with it.</p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Snow showing nicely under the clear skies over New Zealand but showers still feeding into the east. ^JL <a href=\"http://t.co/VQJgoxhsWa\">pic.twitter.com/VQJgoxhsWa</a></p>&mdash; MetService (@MetService) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetService/status/619267646005972992\">July 9, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>",

I saw one car off the road and I heard there was another two.&quot;</p> <p>Conditions were treacherous and frightening, with ice and snow blanketing the highway, he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;They said there were cars and trucks getting stuck going up and down the hill, but they managed to clear those and said if you take it easy you can get to Ohakune.&quot;</p> <p>After a slow moving drive at 25km/h on icy roads in poor visibility, van der Maas made it to Waiouru.</p> <p>&quot;There was a line of about 20 cars got as far as Waiouru and then it closed. Everything looked closed up, but at 11.20 at night in the snow it was hard to find anything.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Quite a few people sleeping in cars, sleeping in trucks. We are stuck, we can't go forward and can't go back.&quot;</p> <p>Equipped with a blanket and phone, plugged into the car charger, van der Maas spent the night cosied up in the car in temperatures below -3.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I left the engine running all night, parked next to the service station, I left it on 20 degrees, I think I got about four hours sleep.&quot;</p> <p>Soldiers from Waiouru Military Camp had rallied, taking out Army issued 4WD vehicles to help pull motorists from snow tracks.&nbsp;</p> <p>Major Pat Hibbs, commandant of the camp, said 60 people were brought back to the camp to spend the night in the barracks.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We had put 50 beds aside. Police rang and we went out and helped bring them back to the barracks, or took them home.&quot;</p> <p>Hibbs himself took a family from Tauranga back to his house for the night, after motels booked out and the barracks were brimming.</p> <p>&quot;As people were coming from the south the Ohakune road closed and the Desert Rd was closed. Some attempted to turn around but the road south of Waiouru closed at 9pm, so they were stuck.&quot;</p> <p>A truck jack-knifed on the National Park Rd had also stalled traffic. Hibbs said most motorists were relieved to hitch a ride back to the camp rather than spend a night in -5 temperatures.</p> <p>Terry Ward also spent the night&nbsp;sleeping in his car as he waited for the Desert Road to open.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was Ward's third night away from home, and with a sick child, he said the situation was less than ideal.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I've got to get back and I have no service [to contact them].&quot;</p> <p>Ward was from Palmerston North and like many other motorists he was stopped in his tracks by the snow and cold conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>He worked for U Drive Palmerston North relocating rental cards and left home on Tuesday expecting to be back later that day, but due to delays and bad weather, he was now down to his last set of clean clothes.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Last night I stayed right here [by the road closed sign] and slept in the car.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I don't want to do another night...everything was full in Turangi last night and I didn't want to go back to Taupo.&quot;</p> <p>Having sat in his car for 16 hours, Ward was hoping to get moving soon so he could get back to his family.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's just one of those things I guess....[but] I can smell myself though.&quot;</p> <p>Truck driver Raye Thompson&nbsp;said he had been working big days due to the weather as he had been held up for hours waiting for roads to open.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I started at 3am yesterday and didn't get home until 10pm, I was held up at National Park for 3 hours.&quot;</p>",

Time was taken off her sentence because of her age and her genuine remorse.</p> <p>The Whangarei woman has since appealed her sentence, saying the judge's sentence was &quot;manifestly excessive&quot;.</p> <p>A Court of Appeal decision released on Friday found the sentence to be appropriate and Wharerau's appeal was dismissed.</p> <p>Wharerau argued that the other cases the judge used to decide on a starting point for her sentence were not comparable.</p> <p>The other cases involved deliberate stabbings that had some degree of premeditation rather than accidental stabbings as in Wharerau's case, she said.</p> <p>However, the court found the starting point used by the judge in Wharerau's sentencing was &quot;within the appropriate range having regard to the nature and circumstances of the act that led to the victim's death&quot;.</p> <p>Therefore, her sentence was not manifestly excessive, according to the judgment.</p> <p>Wharerau and her boyfriend, who was 17 at the time of the incident, had been together about six months when she stabbed him with a kitchen knife.</p> <p>There was some &quot;low-level violence&quot; in the relationship, the decision said.</p> <p>In October 2012 the couple got into an argument over the use of Wharerau's phone.</p> <p>During the argument Wharerau's boyfriend slapped her across the face and in return she punched him in the back.</p> <p>When she tried to use the phone he broke it then threw it on the floor multiple times.</p> <p>She went into the kitchen and her boyfriend followed her into the confined space.</p> <p>Wharerau said he was &quot;really angry&quot; with her.</p> <p>She grabbed a knife off the kitchen bench and swung it in the victim's direction to scare him away but the knife stabbed him in the chest.</p> <p>The knife punctured his lung and his heart sac.</p> <p>Wharerau then rinsed the knife and went to the neighbour's to call for help.

            "body": "<p>Renters are unwittingly gifting the Government millions of dollars in tenancy bonds.</p> <p>Documents obtained under the Official Information Act show for the five years to 2014, more than $17 million in unclaimed or uncollected tenancy bonds has been reclaimed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).</p> <p>An unclaimed bond refers to a tenancy bond that has not been claimed within two months of the tenancy being terminated. An uncollected bond means an application to retrieve the money has been processed and the payment approved but the money was not collected within two months.&nbsp;</p> <p>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, after six years that money then belongs to the Crown.&nbsp;</p> <p>In that account, there is $44.6m of unclaimed and uncollected bonds relating to 142,864 tenancies. Already, for the first three months of 2015, there is already almost $640,000 in unclaimed bonds and $1.3m uncollected.</p> <p>Christchurch Tenants' Protection Association educator and advocate Lisa Coulter said the money was often left dwindling in the Government's accounts because tenants were generally unaware of their rights.</p> <p>&quot;It's a huge amount of money \u2013 it's really disappointing,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;What tends to happen is the landlord tells the tenant what's going to happen with their bond money instead of asking them.&quot;</p> <p>Tenants often believed the decision on what happened to the bond was solely up to the landlord, Coulter said, but did not realise their signature was also required before any money was released.</p> <p>Common reasons behind bonds not being claimed were tenants simply wanting to move on from their past tenancy quickly, trouble with bank processing, disputes with landlords that can drag on, or delays when one person in a tenancy changed and the bond centre had to spend time updating files, she said.</p> <p>One of the most common mistakes was people having their tenancy address as the &quot;address for service&quot; on their tenancy form and moving when a tenancy ends, making it difficult to track the person down.</p> <p>&quot;Decisions around bonds and how they're going to be refunded seem to be taking an awful lot longer than they used to be. People often call us frustrated at the timeline,&quot; Coulter said.</p> <p>&quot;The landlord says 'oh well, that's going to be taken out of their bond' and there's an assumption it's all gone.&quot;</p> <p>Coulter said there were ways tenants could protect themselves, most importantly having an alternative address as their address for service and knowing their rights as renters.</p> <p>&quot;Be aware the bond money is theirs and it's reasonable to expect that the process is done as quickly as possible, as there is a real impact.&quot;</p> <p>MBIE spokesman Mike West said the ministry was &quot;committed to ensuring that tenants and landlords have access to their bonds&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;The ministry also takes all reasonable steps to locate and contact tenants and landlords after their tenancy has ended,&quot; he said.</p>",

            "body": "<p>A section of State Highway 39 at Pirongia in the Waikato has reopened after a truck and trailer unit carrying hazardous substances rolled.&nbsp;</p> <p>Emergency services were called to the crash near McClure St in the town just before 4am on Friday.</p> <p>The truck and trailer unit heading north to Auckland crashed onto its side on the highway, said Northern Fire Communications shift manager Scott Osmond.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The truck is sitting on a street light,&quot; said Osmond.</p> <p>It was carrying a load of hazardous substances, including pails of epoxy resins and lubricants.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hamilton police's Senior Sergeant Tim Anderson said the resins were a low-level hazardous substance and there has been no reported spillage.&nbsp;</p> <p>The driver of the truck was taken to Waikato Hospital with a shoulder injury.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The truck has come to a left hand bend and lost control, and rolled.&quot;</p> <p>Anderson said police were investigating how the driver had lost control but there were no signs of black ice on the road.</p> <p>Waikato District Road Policing Manager, Inspector Freda Grace, said the Commercial Vehicle Investigation Unit were looking into what part, if any, fatigue played a part.</p> <p>Heavy lifting equipment was being brought in to right the truck, but that would take several hours.</p> <p>Diversions were in place between McClure and Beechy sts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Diversions will be in place but given it's a Friday and the first week of the school holidays, this route is very popular with skiers heading down to the slopes so we're urging people to allow themselves plenty of time.</p> <p>&quot;Today's crash is of particular concern for us as it comes a day after a tanker crash in the same area. As well as a popular skiing route this is a popular trucking route as well so we need to ensure road users are sharing the road and driving to the conditions- including fitness of vehicles and driver on the road.&quot;</p> <p>Mrs Grace said this week had been particularly challenging for Waikato motorists with heavy rains presenting challenges earlier on and extremely cold conditions presenting new challenges.</p> <p>&quot;Given SH39 is a focus highway for our staff over the year, we want to see all road users leaving the speed to the slopes and arrive at their destinations well rested and ready for the off-road challenges.&quot;</p>",

China is home to about 20 million Muslims spread across its vast territory, only a portion of whom are Uighurs.</p> <p>&quot;Thailand sent around 100 Uighurs back to China yesterday. Thailand has worked with China and Turkey to solve the Uighur Muslim problem. We have sent them back to China after verifying their nationality,&quot; Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, deputy government spokesman, told reporters on Thursday.</p> <p>A group of more than 170 Uighurs were identified as Turkish citizens and sent to Turkey, he said. Fifty others still need to have their citizenship verified.</p> <p>&quot;If we send them back [to China] and there is a problem that is not our fault,&quot; said Prime Minister Prayuth, the general who led a coup against Thailand's elected government in May 2014.</p> <p>The United States condemned the deportations and asked Thailand to stop them, saying the Uighurs could face harsh treatment in China, State Department spokesman John Kirby said.</p> <p>&quot;We strongly urge the government of Thailand, and other governments in countries where Uighurs have taken refuge, not to carry out further forced deportations of ethnic Uighurs,&quot; Kirby said in a statement. He also urged China to ensure proper treatment of the Uighurs.</p> <p>Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, would not confirm whether the Uighurs had been deported to China but spoke in general terms about the issue at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Thursday, saying the Uighurs were &quot;firstly Chinese&quot;.</p> <p>Beijing denies restricting the Uighurs' religious freedoms and blames Islamist militants for a rise in violent attacks in Xinjiang in the past three years in which hundreds have died.</p>",

Many of those children experienced physical and sexual abuse from the very adults who were supposed to care for them.</p> <p>More than 1300 applications for payouts were received by the June 30 deadline, the Justice Ministry said Thursday. Around 600 of the 737 applications processed so far were approved, and the rest should be considered by the beginning of next year.</p> <p>The practice of sending poor children to farms started in the early 1800s and was in full swing until the 1960s, a period during which Switzerland was transformed from a rural backwater into a wealthy and modern society.</p> <p>Officially, authorities only took children away from parents who were too poor to properly care for them. In practice, historians say, Swiss authorities also targeted the children of single mothers and others whom they considered to have fallen into &quot;moral destitution&quot;.</p> <p>The government is working on plans for a full 300 million-franc compensation fund for all victims.</p> <p>Switzerland's regional and municipal governments, companies, private organizations and individuals contributed to the existing fund for particularly needy recipients.</p>",

During the footage a diver is shown sticking his torso out of shark cage to touch the giant animal. Hoyos Padilla told LiveScience expedition dive master Joel Ibarra was trying to push the monster away from the cage to try to prevent her from getting hurt on its pointy corners. The shark had a big laceration on its right side, he said.</p> <p>Deep Blue was pregnant at the time she was filmed in late 2013 - which only accentuated her massive proportions - and perhaps 50-years-old. She was spotted near Guadalupe Island, in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico. Scientists on the trip tagged Deep Blue with a transponder, enabling an autonomous underwater vehicle to follow the shark for more than three hours.</p> <p>Footage taken at the time was shown on Discovery Channel's <i>Shark Week</i>&nbsp;coverage in 2014. Hoyos Padilla published the new 50-second clip of Deep Blue swimming round the dive cage after he found it on his computer.</p> <p>And Deep Blue is not the only great white causing excitement.</p> <p>Photographer Remo Sabatini was filming one of the animals tearing into some bait beside his boat in Mossel Bay, South Africa, when another made a startling appearance.</p><p><iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOIp6_oOx4Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>",

Here's a taste of great and less great moments from their safaris to New Zealand.</p> <p><b>Dan Carter masterclass: 2005, Westpac Stadium, Wellington</b></p> <p>Dan Carter was hailed as the best first-five ever by Kiwi scribes after the All Blacks won 48-18, while British and Irish scribblers instead touted him as the best ever flyhalf. Whatever, he was sublime and scored 33 points as the Lions conceded more points than ever before (Carter almost topped the 38 that was the previous record on his own). When the Lions led 7-0 after two minutes it was simply the calm before the Dan-mage began as the All Blacks won the series 3-0.</p> <p><b>Gareth Edwards and Barry John: all tests, 1971</b></p> <p>When the Lions arrived, schoolboys scoffed at their pasty white legs and the pockets in their shorts. Lions to the slaughter. By the time they left, they were spiralling out long passes like Welsh halfback Gareth Edwards and kicking goals using his compatriot Barry John's round-the-corner style. Some even - heaven forbid - contemplated drop goals, a la first-five maestro John. And they didn't stop there - they sidestepped like David Duckham and Gerald Davies, and dreamed of growing JPR Williams sideburns. Lions won the series 2-1 (one draw).</p> <p><b>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/international/70127069/auckland-to-host-two-british-and-irish-lions-tests-in-2017-new-zealand-tour\">British and Irish Lions announce NZ tour details</a></b></p> <p><b>Don Clarke puts in the boot: 1959, Carisbrook</b></p> <p>Some regard the 1959 LIons as the best to tour here, armed as they were with sublime Irish winger Tony O'Reilly, who scored 22 tries on tour, and fellow wing Peter Jackson. In the first test the Lions scored four tries, but Clarke kicked six penalties. In these days of five points tries the Lions would have won. The post-match function was reportedly a sullen affair in which the Lions didn't&nbsp;hide their disappointment after the All Blacks won 18-17 before taking the series 3-1.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Grant Batty sets sail: 1977, Athletic Park</b></p> <p>A fiery wee winger with a hangdog moustache, Grant Batty took a vital intercept in the first test at Athletic Park and set sail for the line. Hampered by a knee injury, he was almost rundown by prop Graeme Price. Batty was prompted to retire, his right knee too damaged to let him play the way he craved. It was the last of his 15 tests which the All Blacks won 16-12. The All Blacks won series 3-1.</p> <p><b>Ian Kirkpatrick the Lion killer: Lancaster Park, 1971</b></p> <p>Loosie &quot;Kirky&quot; somehow got the ball inside his own half, and found himself thundering down Lancaster Park for one of the great All Black tries. He doesn't rate it all that highly, as the All Blacks had the game won at that stage - he liked a match-winner in Cape Town the year before more. While proud of getting by brilliant Lions fullback Williams, he was all modesty in scoring the try. &quot;I've always felt a bit embarrassed about that one&quot;, he once said. All Blacks 22, Lions 12</p> <p><b>Ken Jones, Olympic sprinter leaves All Blacks grasping and gasping: fourth test, 1950</b></p> <p>Jones won an Olympic medal for sprinting and was fastest wingers in international rugby. Given space by genius namesake Lewis Jones, and a defensive mistake by the All Blacks, he raced half the length of the field at Eden Park and stunned the All Blacks with his pace. It was that era's &quot;try from the ends of the earth&quot; as the All Blacks won 11-8. The All Blacks won series 3-0 (one draw)</p> <p><b>Battle of Lancaster Park: Lions vs Canterbury, 1971</b></p> <p>The Lions beat Canterbury 14-3 but had Ray McLoughlin and Sandy Carmichael, their two best props, punched out of the tour in an ugly game. Frontrowers apparently have long memories - in the 1966 game between Canterbury and the Lions violence erupted in the first scrum. In 1971 Carmichael annoyed the red and blacks by boring in on hooker Tane Norton, so copped it after he was warned twice by Alister Hopkinson, his opposing prop. What hurt Carmichael most was being called &quot;a whinging Pom&quot; by louts on the embankment. He was a proud Scot.</p> <p><b>Stu Wilson, on fire: 1983</b></p> <p>Stu Wilson was the glittering jewel in a drab test series, lost 4-0 by the Lions. He scored a try in the second test, his first test try for nearly two years, to equal the New Zealand record. After scoring Wilson raised a single finger to signal &quot;I'm No 1&quot;. In the fourth test he scored three more tries. His tally in tests ended at 19. All Blacks won series 4-0.</p>",

            "body": "<p>New Zealand are through to the Olympic qualifying final for the Oceania region after a 2-0 win over Vanuatu in Port Moresby.</p> <p>Coach Anthony Hudson won't be happy with the performance he witnessed on Friday afternoon, but will be relieved that they got the job done against a plucky Vanuatu side.</p> <p>Fiji await in the final of the Olympic qualifiers after beating hosts Papua New Guinea 3-1 in the other semifinal. New Zealand will need a much better first half showing in the final with Rio qualification on the line.</p> <p>New Zealand were uninterested, lazy and at times entirely hopeless in the first half against Vanuatu.</p> <p>Only Bill Tuiloma, Monty Patterson and Louis Fenton showed bright moments for New Zealand as the team allowed Vanuatu to get their tails up.</p> <p>There was no Kiwi midfield to speak of, just an orange wall of Vanuatu players peering towards the sky as long balls peppered their back line.</p> <p>Tuiloma, playing just in front of New Zealand's centre backs, had moments of class - including an early interception and long pass which should have led to the opening goal. Patterson's cut back found Luka Prelevic on the edge of the area, but his strike was tame.</p> <p>That whole attack only involved two passes, and at no time did New Zealand appear capable of stringing sets of them or long periods of possession together.</p> <p>When they did attack it was through Fenton on the right wing, his crosses causing a couple of nervous moments in Vanuatu's backline, including when Alex Rufer glanced a header wide off the upright.</p> <p>But as New Zealand struggled Vanuatu sensed their chance, pushing forward with plenty of pace but a lack of accuracy. They were fighting for every ball, winning the 50/50 challenges and making New Zealand defenders look ordinary for much of the half.</p> <p>One mix-up saw goalkeeper Max Crocombe leave his box to contest a long ball with his own defender, the result of which was the ball going just wide of the Kiwi goal.</p> <p>From the corner Vanuatu captain Brian Kaltack had a free header, Crocombe making amends with a point blank save.</p> <p>Coach Hudson wasn't a happy man, subbing Prelevic before the 40-minute mark after an annonymous display, introducing Moses Dyer.</p> <p>Whatever Hudson said to his side at the break worked, with a more urgent New Zealand side emerging from the changing sheds.</p> <p>Fenton turned and hit a thunderous effort from 20 metres out which was well saved moments after the restart, and from the corner New Zealand had the lead.</p> <p>When a header wasn't cleared by Vanuatu, Patterson was found inside the six yard box, turning the ball into the net with his left boot.</p> <p>Tuiloma doubled the lead in the 56th minute, getting to the front post before his marker to head home.</p> <p>Vanuatu's heads dropped after the second goal and New Zealand's attackers started picking holes in the defence.</p> <p>As the match wore on it returned to the scrappy affair seen in the first half, but New Zealand were in full control with those two goals easing the pressure on their shoulders.</p>",

All my family went to watch. Just seeing the build-up, the atmosphere and just how much passion was thrown out there and just the fans, how much they loved it and how much they breath State of Origin ...&quot;</p> <p>Sitting down with your correspondent for a magazine interview, the Mackay-raised 27-year-old with a parent from either side of the Tasman admits: &quot;I thought to myself 'I could be playing this'.</p> <p>&quot;At the same time, I've happily pledged my allegiance to the Kiwis and that's where my allegiance lies. But I can't not say that I wish I was playing State of Origin.&quot;</p> <p>The comments speak to several issues regarding the future of the venerated interstate series. Hoffman's national team \u2013 now so strong that he finds it hard to get into it \u2013 recently beat the best of the Origin series, 26-12.</p> <p>Would an All Black wish to play in a NSW v Queensland rugby union match?</p> <p>The British broadcaster Rod Studd, of Sky television, tweeted me during Origin III saying: &quot;Why not replace a tired Origin format with three Tests v the world's number one team. Is it purely a commercial exercise now?&quot;</p> <p>The question displayed an ignorance of State of Origin's cultural significance. Every seat at Suncorp Stadium on Wednesday night for Queensland's 52-6 win was full and some estimates had one in four Australians watching on television.</p> <p>But Rod's suggestion also had its basis in logic. If State of Origin becomes the best of the second best (or even third best, should his mob have some overdue success soon) then it can hardly claim to be the game's pinnacle.</p> <p>But the answer to the issues raised by Hoffman and Studd is disarmingly simple: NSW and Queensland are where rugby league is most popular in the world, so when they play each other, it's bound to be a big deal.</p> <p>It always will be.</p> <p>Past a certain point, quality is irrelevant. Does the Melbourne Cup's popularity among the casual fan from one year to the next fluctuate according to the strength of the field? Of course not.</p> <p>Like most pop culture touchstones in the social media age, State of Origin is going to get bigger and bigger. New media has a voracious appetite for established IP upon which it can feed and Origin is perfect for this</p> <p>But as the NRL draws more and more players from outside its participating states, the pool each will be able to draw upon will shrink. After second-choice hooker Michael Ennis, the Blues would have to have called up St George Illawarra's Mitch Rein, who has just been suspended.</p> <p>Their lack of depth in the halves, meanwhile, is no doubt being written about as you read this by a dozen journalists, bloggers and tweeters.</p> <p>On the surface, there is nothing wrong with Origin being less representative of the talent in the NRL \u2013 which is increasingly coming from the [Pacific] islands, then Europe and even other Australian states \u2013 and still continuing to be a hugely powerful cash cow.</p> <p>But I can foresee two potential complications.</p> <p>One: how can we justify holding up a competition boasting the finest rugby league talent in the world so two Australian states play each other? I know we can justify it financially, but not in terms of fairness and equality, surely.</p> <p>I accept this is an extreme example I am using for effect: but would the English Premier League introduce split rounds so Lincolnshire could play Cumbria?</p> <p>Secondly, can we really use Origin to drive expansion with games in Melbourne, Auckland, Hong Kong and the Sea Of Tranquillity when its relevance beyond its homelands will no doubt suffer as the NRL's playing population becomes more exotic?</p> <p>If, in terms of the percentage of players eligible, Origin becomes something like City-Country in two decades, do we really want it to be our front window as a sport, most visible to outsiders? I think not.</p> <p>Rugby league is at a pivotal moment in its until-now-stunted development as we digest the 2015 Origin series.</p> <p>And if I could name a test case, a patient zero, then it would be Semi Radradra.</p> <p>The Parramatta winger is a box-office star who is not eligible for either NSW or Queensland because he didn't live in either state before the age of 13. That is, unless you exploit a cynical loophole: that he played his first league in Sydney, after converting from rugby union.</p> <p>If Radradra ever plays for the Blues, we might as well move the judiciary back to Phillip Street and ask if Winfield are still looking to sponsor someone. That would be a game stuck in the past, determined to hang its hat on a game between two Australian states at the expense of ripping every other coat hook out of the wall before incinerating them.</p> <p>Radradra should be the poster boy for rugby league's broader horizons, not a vehicle of selfish short-termism.</p> <p>By all means continue to bath in the blinding glow of Origin. But as big a slice of the business as it is for the NRL, that doesn't equate to its share of the future.</p> <p>Park Origin somewhere it can continue to do its job for those who are eligible and keep the cash registers ringing, far enough away from our other assets so it stops eating them whole.</p> <p>Then work on giving those who aren't eligible or interested an opportunity to stand in the light as well.</p>",

            "body": "<p><br /> All Blacks wing Cory Jane will make his long-awaited return from injury with the New Zealand Barbarians in Auckland next week but Ardie Savea won't recover in time.</p> <p>Jane missed the Super Rugby semifinal and final and All Blacks test in Samoa with a hamstring injury but has been named to return in the 23-man Barbarians squad that takes on NZ Maori in a one-off match at Eden Park on July 18.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the likes of Charles Piutau, Waisake Naholo and Nehe Milner-Skudder vying for All Blacks spots, right wing is probably the most contested spot in the All Blacks. Jane's safe nature under the high ball and powerful left fend are valuable but his form needs to justify inclusion.&nbsp;</p> <p>After a quiet Super Rugby campaign on the right wing, where he scored three tries from 12 games with the Hurricanes, Jane will be desperate to make an impact and prove he deserves to be picked&nbsp; in the All Blacks' World Cup squad.&nbsp;</p> <p>This will be the first clash between these two teams since the 2010 Maori Centenary Series. The Maori won that match, 37-31, in Whangarei.</p> <p>The Barbarians squad also includes George Moala and Tom Taylor, who were involved the All Blacks test in Apia, along with Ofa Tu'ungafasi and Seta Tamanivalu, who also made the trip. Hurricanes flanker Savea is a notable omission because of the knee injury that forced him out of the Super Rugby final last Saturday night.</p> <p>Other features of the squad are the selection of seven players involved in the Super Rugby final, along with former All Blacks James Parsons, Luke Whitelock and Dominic Bird and two NZ Under-20 stars \u2013 Auckland loose forward Blake Gibson and Taranaki halfback Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi \u2013 who won their World Cup recently.<br /> <br /> The Barbarians will be coached by Highlanders assistant coach Scott McLeod, Hawke's Bay's Craig Philpott and Auckland's Paul Feeney.</p> <p>&quot;There's a lot of new, emerging and exciting talent, and some who are currently in the All Blacks environment,&quot; McLeod said.</p> <p>&quot;Both Blake and Te Toiroa had outstanding campaigns for the New Zealand Under-20. It's Barbarian tradition to have a young guy involved and we felt comfortable with these guys coming in for the two available slots.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Barbarians will assemble as a full squad in Auckland on Tuesday and have planned a visit to their clubrooms base at Eden Park to gain a feel for the club and the famous scarlet jersey they will wear.<br /> <br /> &quot;We want the players to understand who they are representing and why, so they will check out the photos and memorabilia on the walls and talk to the club members,&quot; McLeod said.</p> <p>&quot;We want them to feel they are playing for something special and for them to own that performance,&quot; he added.</p> <p>McLeod, who said the side will adhere to the traditional open rugby of the Barbarians, is under no illusions as to how tough the Maori will be, especially as they will be coming off Saturday's international against Fiji in Suva.</p> <p><br /> <b>Barbarians team:</b></p> <p><b>Forwards:&nbsp;</b>Mitchell Graham (Taranaki),&nbsp;Reg Goodes (Wellington),&nbsp;Ofa Tu'ungafasi (Auckland),&nbsp;Ben Tameifuna (Waikato),&nbsp;Liam Coltman (Otago),&nbsp;James Parsons (North Harbour),&nbsp;Alex Ainley (Tasman),&nbsp;Joseph Wheeler (Tasman),&nbsp;Dominic Bird (Canterbury),&nbsp;Brad Shields (Wellington),&nbsp;Blake Gibson (Auckland),&nbsp;Luke Whitelock (Canterbury),&nbsp;Jordan Taufua (Counties).<br /> <b>Backs:&nbsp;</b>Mitchell Drummond (Canterbury), Te Toiroa Tahuiorangi (Taranaki), Andrew Horrell (Hawke's Bay), Ihaia West (Hawke's Bay), George Moala (Auckland), Seta Tamanivalu (Taranaki), Patrick Osborne (Canterbury), Cory Jane (Wellington), Richard Buckman (Hawke's Bay), Tom Taylor (Canterbury).</p>",

That sees the first and third tests being played at Auckland's Eden Park, with the second at Westpac Stadium in Wellington.</p> <p>NZR chief executive Steve Tew said the rationale regarding the midweek and build-up matches was simple, despite provincial unions having always played Lions teams, including the last time they toured New Zealand in 2005.</p> <p>They've been part of the magic of the whole exercise, but aren't feasible given the 2017 series takes place between June 3 and July 17.</p> <p>&quot;In 2005, of course, Super Rugby had finished by the time the Lions arrived and the players were back in the provinces and so we played [as] provincial unions,&quot; Tew said at Friday morning's announcement in Wellington.</p> <p>&quot;That's not the case with the current competition. The players are still within their Super teams and we would have to have taken them away from those environments and formed ITM Cup teams and the rest of the players in those teams wouldn't have been contracted and playing so, logically, this is the way to go.</p> <p>&quot;The Lions are very happy playing the Super Rugby sides, they think that will be a better level of competition and so, yep, it's a break from tradition but it's a continuation of the overall tradition of a decent-length tour and we think it'll be pretty exciting.&quot;</p> <p>In at least one nod to the tradition Tew talked about, the Lions tour will begin in Whangarei, which was once the starting point for many trips by overseas teams. There, on June 3, they'll meet an Invitation XV made up of provincial and Heartland Championship players which Tew said would not feature in the Lions' subsequent clashes with Super Rugby sides.</p> <p>The other talking point will, inevitably, be the fact that Eden Park hosts tests on June 24 and July 17. More than 20,000 Lions fans flocked to New Zealand for the 2005 tour and Tew said the expectation was that those numbers would be exceeded in two years' time.</p> <p>Aside from anything else, the fact that Auckland will be the getting off point for many of them, appears to have been a factor in the scheduling. South Island fans will have to make do with seeing the Crusaders host the Lions on June 10, before it's the Highlanders turn on June 13.</p> <p>&quot;We are taking a big test match to Christchurch [against South Africa in 2016] and a very big test match to Dunedin [against Australia in 2017] and we think if you put that into context of [the Lions] playing the Highlanders and the Crusaders, over the two years the South Island does OK,&quot; said Tew.</p> <p>All the same, some fans will feel short-changed.</p> <p>&quot;That might be the way you present it, but it's not the way we would [and] that's why we've gone about this with a two-year view in mind. I mean, you've got to be realistic, we cannot host a British and Irish Lions test in Christchurch withe the current stadium that's there, it's just simply not up to this level of fixture.</p> <p>&quot;Despite the parochial views of most people that live south of here, it would be a considerable struggle for Dunedin to cope with the logistics of the hordes of fans that are travelling. We think that, on balance, we are taking a Bledisloe Cup match to Dunedin and we are taking a very big match to Christchurch over this two-year period and [the Lions] will play the Highlanders and the Crusaders, so we're comfortable we've got the balance right.&quot;</p> <p>Another feature of the scheduling is that North Harbour's QBE Stadium will host a test against South Africa in 2017. Tew said it would amount of &quot;half a home test match&quot; for the Springboks, although the ground did struggle to accommodate matches during the Fifa U-20 World Cup and this test would be a level or two above that, in terms of the clamour for tickets and the need to get people to and from the ground and keep them fed and watered, which were all issues during the football.</p> <p><b>AT A GLANCE</b></p> <p><b>2017 British and Irish Lions Tour</b></p> <p>3 June: v Provincial Union Team, Toll Stadium, Whangarei<br /> 7 June: v Blues, Eden Park, Auckland<br /> 10 June: v Crusaders, AMI Stadium, Christchurch<br /> 13 June: v Highlanders, Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin<br /> 17 June: v Maori All Blacks, Rotorua International Stadium<br /> 20 June: v Chiefs, Waikato Stadium Hamilton<br /> 24 June: v All Blacks (1st test), Eden Park, Auckland<br /> 27 June: v Hurricanes, Westpac Stadium, Wellington<br /> 1 July: v All Blacks (2nd test), Westpac Stadium, Wellington<br /> 8 July: v All Blacks (3rd test), Eden Park, Auckland</p> <p><b>2016 All Blacks schedule</b></p> <p>11 June: v Wales, Eden Park, Auckland<br /> 18 June: v Wales, Westpac Stadium, Wellington&nbsp;<br /> 25 June: v Wales, Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin<br /> 27 August: v Australia, Westpac Stadium, Wellington<br /> 10 September: v Argentina, Waikato Stadium, Hamilton<br /> 17 September v South Africa, AMI Stadium, Christchurch</p>",

            "body": "<p>More than 130,000 fanboys and girls out in force for pop-culture's biggest gathering - San Diego Comic-Con.</p> <p>Day One on Thursday (local time) saw the San Diego Convention Center come alive with all manner of heroes, <g class=\"gr_ gr_229 gr-alert gr_gramm Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" data-gr-id=\"229\"> villains </g> and other assorted creatures, from &quot; <g class=\"gr_ gr_145 gr-alert gr_spell ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" data-gr-id=\"145\"> Sharknado </g>&quot; sharks to characters from the original &quot;Kill Bill.&quot;</p> <p>And oh yes, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; gang was in full force, too \u2014 as it should be. It was the Storm Troopers who helped start the Comic-Con costume craze light years ago.</p> <p>Some highlights from Day One of the nerdfest:</p> <p><b>BATMAN, WONDER WOMAN COSTUMES</b></p> <p>Behold Ben Affleck's Batsuit - both of them. Comic-Con put the costumes from their next big superhero flick &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; out for all to see. And there was quite a lot to take in, especially Wonder Woman's whole new getup with some original comic book touchstones, like the lasso of truth.</p> <p>First let's talk Wonder Woman. Director Zack Snyder released an image of the new Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot, in her warrior costume last Comic-Con. But now the fans had the opportunity to see her ensemble up close, and it turns out that Wonder Woman fights injustice and bad guys in wedge gladiator sandals.</p> <p>The rest of her traditional accessories have also been slightly <g class=\"gr_ gr_192 gr-alert gr_spell ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" data-gr-id=\"192\"> Xena'ed </g> up. The cuff bracelets have markings on them, her tiara has been toned down to neutral colors, and she's got a shield with markings along the rim (extra points for anyone who can translate that for us). While it's kind of odd to see the superhero heels next to Batman's wearable tumbler suit (why must all female action heroes wear heels?) the detail on Wonder Woman's costume is still pretty spectacular. And fairly traditional with the aforementioned warrior color tint.</p> <p>Now on to the bat. Back in April when Warner Bros. released the Batman v Superman trailer, the audience got a good look at Bruce Wayne's new Superman-fighting super armor. And now you too can analyze the massive creation. Check out the boots on this bad boy. This is no doubt some sort of Kryptonian alien repelling <g class=\"gr_ gr_196 gr-alert gr_gramm Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" data-gr-id=\"196\"> machine, </g> because we all know that Superman (played by Henry Cavill) can rip through almost all earthly metals. However, it is interesting that while building this insane armor Bruce Wayne paused to add a cape. What is an ensemble without a little flair?</p> <p>Also new: Batman's brand-new utility belt, which he has on in the regular/daytime Batsuit that was also presented on the DC Entertainment booth.</p> <p><i>Batman v.

            "body": "<p>Kristin shot J.R.<br /> <br /> <i>Newhart</i> was all a dream.<br /> <br /> And that book the Kanamits are toting around on <i>The Twilight Zone</i>? It's a cookbook!<br /> <br /> I come to reveal spoilers, not to hide them.<br /> <br /> Modern television viewing, which allows us to watch nearly any show ever made pretty much whenever we wish, has come upon us so quickly that social convention is still catching up.<br /> <br /> The critical question still to be settled among polite society: Where does discussion end and spoiling begin?<br /> <br /> Lately, it seems that the pendulum has swung to the favour of people who feel they should be able to approach a series unsullied, castigating those who might \u2013 however innocently \u2013 dare to try to discuss a show they are still watching, or even thinking about watching.</p> <p>Who hasn't tried to analyze the latest episode of <i>Game of Thrones</i> with the office fan club only to be shooed away by a co-worker who isn't caught up? Or been approached by a friend who has &quot;finally watched<i> House of Cards&quot;</i> only to be scolded for revealing a plot point that comes after Episode 1?</p> <p>A colleague recently was castigated by a reader for writing about Emily Kinney and &quot;spoiling&quot; that her character had died on <i>The Walking Dead</i> \u2013 seven months earlier.</p> <p>I say it is time for the pendulum to swing back.<br /> <br /> It is time to free the people who watch television to talk about their shows and for those who lag behind to accept that spoiling simply is a risk of a leisurely viewing pace.<br /> <br /> Do I need to declare a spoiler alert before writing that the New England Patriots won the last Super Bowl because someone might still have an unwatched copy on their DVR?<br /> <br /> Of course not. So why do some viewers believe they must be extended the &quot;courtesy&quot; of universal silence by the rest of the world when it comes to fictional television?<br /> <br /> Naturally, there are limits. I believe people can reasonably ask those around them for 48 hours of spoiler-free space after a new episode airs. For series from online sites like Netflix that arrive all at once, a month after the release date is an acceptable cushion, especially for the later episodes.<br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is up to the procrastinators to steer clear of social media. Those spoiled by reading their Twitter feeds can only blame themselves.<br /> <br /> There are certain elements we have an obligation to be circumspect about, for a few years at least. Plot twists that significantly affect the path of the story should not be blared out in mixed company. The solutions to murder mysteries should be protected.<br /> <br /> Still, all this concern about spoilers is largely misplaced. A good television series is more than a plot; our enjoyment comes from how the plot is conveyed: what the characters are like, how the story changes them, how our emotions are affected, how the themes of the story illuminate our own lives.<br /> <br /> Does knowing that Miss Bennet marries Mr. Darcy make us like <i>Pride &amp; Prejudice</i>&nbsp;any less? Were you able to watch <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> a second time knowing that Darth Vader was Luke's father? I'm guessing you know how Janet Leigh's shower turns out in <i>Psycho</i> even if you haven't seen the movie. That doesn't make it any less great of a film.<br /> <br /> And so it should be with a television series. Learning of an important plot twist ahead of watching a show doesn't ruin anything. It removes the element of surprise from a very small moment of a long experience.</p> <p>A 2011 study from U.C. San Diego even concluded that spoilers increased readers' enjoyment of literature.</p> <p>So let's ease up on the demand to be spoiler-free. If you are late to a series, accept that you might learn a plot point or two in advance. It might make things better.</p> <p><b>SPEAK FREELY<br /> <br /> </b>Here are 10 &quot;spoilers&quot; it is OK to discuss in public without warning. Listed in reverse chronological order:<br /> <br /> <b>Dr. McDreamy gets bad medical care on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>.</b> Let's see: Actor feuds with producers and talks extensively about his desire to leave a show. How did we think this would turn out?<br /> <br /> <b>Walter White dies at the end of <i>Breaking Bad</i>.</b> And Hamlet dies at the end of <i>Hamlet</i>. It's what happens at the conclusion of a tragedy. What is important is how Walt dies and what his death means.<br /> <br /> <b>The girls of <i>Orphan Black</i> are clones.</b> Yes, it is an important reveal in Season 1. Then again, if you didn't figure that out weeks before the reveal, then this show is over your head.<br /> <br /> <b>Matthew Crawley of <i>Downton Abbey</i> is a bad driver.</b> The death of Dan Stevens' character was one of the worst-kept secrets in television history. Stevens quit the series to make movies in America. We all knew he was going to die, but no one could have predicted the artless way his demise was worked into the story.<br /> <br /> <b>Eddard Stark gets executed on <i>Game of Thrones</i>.</b> The entire show rests on Eddard being killed at the end of Season 1 and his heirs scattered. It's what <i>Game of Thrones</i> is about. &quot;Spoiling&quot; this is like spoiling that <i>Star Trek</i> takes place in the future.<br /> <br /> <b>There are no answers to <i>Lost</i>.</b> Before anyone invests 100 hours or so in watching <i>Lost</i>, they should be aware that the many riddles posed in the first six seasons will not be answered in the seventh. What do 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 signify? How did the island lure the castaways? Why was Walt so important? You will never find out.<br /> <br /> <b><i>The Sopranos</i> cuts to black.</b> It is difficult to be alive in the 21st century and not be aware of the final image of HBO's groundbreaking series. Besides, knowing this tells you absolutely nothing about the 86 episodes that preceded it.<br /> <br /> <b>Carrie marries Big in <i>Sex and the City</i>.</b> This was such an unsatisfying and illogical ending to an otherwise fun series that all prospective viewers should be warned in advance to avoid TV breakage.</p> <p><b>No. 6 is No. 1 in <i>The Prisoner</i>.</b> This psychedelic '60s relic was hard to follow, but if you didn't figure the answer to &quot;Who is No. 1?&quot; by Episode 2, you were doing too many drugs. The real mystery \u2013 one still up for discussion \u2013 is not who is No. 1, but why is he No. 1? Plus, the reveal happened nearly 50 years ago.</p> <p><b>Series based on history are fair game.</b> I've got some bad news: Anne Boleyn gets beheaded in <i>Wolf Hall</i> and <i>The Tudors</i>. Thomas Cromwell, too. Julius Caesar's friends stab him to death in <i>Rome</i>.</p> <p><b>KEEP QUIET</b></p> <p>Here are five spoilers you probably should still keep the lid on:</p> <p><b>The rest of those <i>Game of Thrones</i> deaths.</b> This show kills of regular characters with alarming regularity, and rarely with warning. Best to let the uninitiated go wander as unspoiled as possible \u2013&nbsp;although there has been so much talk about the &quot;red wedding&quot; that most will figure that one out.</p> <p><b>The identity of A.</b> The whole point of <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> is discovering just who A is. But it's OK to tell prospective viewers that the answer keeps changing and you're not really sure the writers even know.</p> <p><b>The end of Season 2 of<i> Homeland</i>.</b> This is the kind of twist that is both a complete surprise and yet intrinsic to what happens afterward. Let the newbies enjoy it.</p> <p><b>What happens between Dexter Morgan and the Trinity Killer.</b> The climax of the fourth season of <i>Dexter</i> is perfectly shocking and shockingly perfect.</p> <p><b>Who killed Laura Palmer.</b> Yes, <i>Twin Peaks</i> is nearly 25 years old. But just as in <i>Pretty Little Liars,</i> this mystery is the cornerstone of the entire series \u2013 and the information might be important to the upcoming remake/sequel.<br /> <br /> </p> <p><b>TNS</b></p>",

The apparently genderless characters have become&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2015/06/screaming-cornpops-who-are-tearing-apart-society\">something of an uber-meme</a>&nbsp;online, adorning affirmative Facebook posts the world over.</p> <p>Several parents complained, some uploading videos of the offending specimens.&nbsp;</p> <p>Uploader Paul B was happy that his daughter took no interest in the toy. He first heard the cussing when picking it up after her, but wasn't sure until his wife said she heard the same thing.</p> <p>&quot;A McDonalds toy? I mean seriously?&quot;</p> <p>McDonalds claims the toys aren't swearing at all.</p> <p>&quot;Minions speak ' <g class=\"gr_ gr_25 gr-alert gr_spell ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" data-gr-id=\"25\"> Minionese </g>,' which is a random combination of languages and nonsense words and sounds,&quot; their statement explains. &quot;Any perceived similarities to words within the English language are purely coincidental.&quot;</p> <p>In other words, a random string of human voice sounds has accidentally produced the offending statements. Of course, that's how random combinations work: a million monkeys on a million typewriters will produce the work of Shakespeare; a million word sounds garbled together on a million plastic toys will produce a few swear words.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GossipStuff?ref=hl\"><b>Head to our Facebook page for more from Stuff Entertainment</b></a></p>",

            "body": "<p>Those who take advantage of room service, poolside lounging and a gourmet menu on holiday will soon be able to give their pets the same royal treatment.</p> <p>A Hamilton woman has revealed her plans for the country's first luxury pet hotel, which she said will offer state of the art accommodation for cats and dogs as their owners go away on holiday.</p> <p>Nicola Pere has owned and operated Metro Paws doggy daycare in Frankton for two years, and hopes to have her next venture, Metro Paws 'n' Claws Luxury Pet Hotel, up and running by March 2016.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pere's Hilton, of sorts, will include air conditioned suites, a daycare environment during daylight hours and a gourmet menu with raw food options. And that's just the beginning, Pere said.</p> <p>&quot;We are looking at adding in a pool, that's stage two ... and hydrotherapy and grooming.&quot;</p> <p>The venture isn't cheap, but based on research on a successful pet hotel in Los Angeles and feedback from some of her 700 customers, Pere is certain there's a need for the service.</p> <p>&quot;To set something like this up is in the vicinity of $600,000,&quot; Pere said.</p> <p>&quot;The feedback from our customers here is they would love a facility like that.&quot;</p> <p>So important is their pet's happiness, that some dog owners are going without daily luxuries so their pets get high-end treatment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pere said one client admitted to giving up her cleaner so her pooch could go to doggy daycare twice a week.</p> <p>&quot;It's a billion dollar industry, the pet industry in New Zealand. The food, the accessories, the toys, there's no expense spared on their dogs.&quot;</p> <p><b>READ MORE<br /> * <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/8572964/How-New-Zealanders-pamper-their-pets\">How New Zealanders pamper their pets<br /> *</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/asia/62939409/groom-service-is-standard-at-singapore-pet-hotel\">Groom service is standard at Singapore pet hotel</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/68363264/New-Zealand-legally-recognises-animals-as-sentient-beings\">* New Zealand legally recognises animals as 'sentient beings'</a></b><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p>Pere said some customers who used her daycare services, a &quot;high proportion&quot; of which were gay and lesbian couples, made similar sacrifices for their pets that they'd make for children.</p> <p>&quot;We have families of two and three [dogs] that come five days a week here and spend hundreds of dollars a week on their pets, but it's their children. You'd spend that on your children.&quot;</p> <p>The Hamilton site is roughly 4000 square metres and is beside Hamilton Airport, Pere said, as well as nearby Mystery Creek which hosts the annual national agricultural Fieldays.</p> <p>Once the &quot;test model&quot; is up and going, Pere said she wants to roll out 12-14 luxury pet hotels across the country. She's currently in the final stages of resource consent with Waipa District Council, she said.</p> <p>Pere said many of her clients were not comfortable leaving their dogs in a kennel &quot;to sleep outside in a pen,&quot; but some did employ pet sitters to visit their home so pets could enjoy normal creature comforts.</p> <p>Pet sitter Kyra Lindsey charges a small fee for in-house visits to pet owners' homes while they're away on holiday.</p> <p>Lindsey, who works as a children's counsellor, said she does the basic chores such as feeding and walking, and will meet with owners before they go away. She said pet owners are becoming more aware of the well being of their furry family member.</p> <p>&quot;People are doing raw food diets for their animals because they notice a difference in their fur.</p> <p>&quot;I think a lot of animals give a lot of healing for people and people are going to judge if they don't understand that. At the end of the day, if that animal has a really strong place in that person's life they want to spend lots of money on it and it's their money, then that's their choice.&quot;</p> <p>In 2014, a luxury pet hotel was unveiled in Singapore, featuring air-conditioned suites, spa services and a limousine shuttle service.</p> <p>Owners can also order grooming and trimming services, a &quot;pawdicure&quot;, mud masks, micro-bubble baths, fur dyeing and aromatherapy massages.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Tariff:</b></p> <p>$35/night for a small dog</p> <p>$39-$45/night for medium-large dogs</p> <p>Family rates available (more than one dog)</p>",

He plays cornhole shirtless. He wants a girl who &quot;knows the difference between 'Astronomy' and 'Astrology.'&quot; And in case any of this sounds dubious, he has photos to prove that he's neither a Nigerian prince nor two midgets in a trenchcoat.</p> <p>Meet Ren Lu You, the Harvard Business School graduate behind <a href=\"dateren.com\" target=\"_blank\">dateren.com.</a></p> <p><img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436480921/532/12181532.jpg\" /></p> <p><i>Ren playing cornhole, shirtless. Photo: DateRen.com&nbsp;</i></p> <p>The site, launched last week by the McLean, Virginia, native, offers US$10,000 (NZ$14,820) to anyone who introduces him to a woman that he dates for more than six months. You has already received thousands of responses \u2014 half of them from women submitting themselves.</p> <p>His admirers hail from IP addresses as distant as Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia. While some might consider this a red flag for scams, You has judged these overseas propositions to be &quot;sincere.&quot; He even received an earnest email from someone offering to sift through his submissions as an unpaid intern.</p> <p>Prior to this windfall, You had tried a slew of dating methods, from getting set up by friends to the Tinder app. After going through a &quot;mixed bag&quot; of several dozen dates, he came away unsatisfied.</p> <p>&quot;I was an econ major in college and I work in finance now,&quot; You says, &quot;so I think a lot about how markets can make things more efficient.&quot;</p> <p><img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436481365/617/12181617.jpg\" /></p> <p><i>He's outdoorsy to boot. Photo: DateRen.com</i></p> <p>This new plan may have backfired a little. Two nights ago, he stayed up until 4am combing through his crowded inbox. You had initially planned to respond to all the submissions, a feat that now appears to be impossible.</p> <p><b>'HE CLEARLY HAS NO SHAME'&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Despite the flood of prospective girlfriends, professional matchmakers are sceptical of the venture. D.C. matchmaker Michelle Jacoby cautions that because he's asking strangers to play Cupid, they may not have his best interests at heart in the way that a friend would.</p> <p>Still, she applauds You for being proactive about finding The One, even if it means that &quot;he may go broke on dinner dates.&quot;</p> <p>Maria Avgitidis, founder of the New York City-based Agape Match, says the monetary reward and public nature of You's campaign make him susceptible to fraud. After all, what's to stop two friends from &quot;pulling a Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and splitting the cash after a six-month ruse?</p> <p>Pointing out that the bachelor has already done interviews with ABC's <i>Good Morning America</i> and <i>People </i>magazine, she adds, &quot;He clearly has no shame.&quot; Single women who might otherwise have found You attractive are likely to be turned off by the media attention that they would receive for dating him. &quot;This guy sounds like an incredible narcissist,&quot; Avgitidis says. &quot;Our clients would never do anything like this.&quot;</p> <p><img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436481267/579/12181579.jpg\" /></p> <p><i>Blue steel. Photo: DateRen.com</i></p> <p>But You insists that his aims are pure. &quot;I just want to find somebody who is really great, to date them and be their boyfriend,&quot; he says. &quot;Who knows where it might go from there?&quot;</p> <p>Though he has been contacted by a TLC representative about potentially starring in a reality show, You has no interest in becoming &quot;an F-List celebrity, like Pauly D or whatever-his-name-is on<i> Jersey Shore</i>.&quot; He already has his hands full as an associate at a private equity firm \u2014 &quot;a real job.&quot;</p> <p>At the very least, You's dating profile now has more hits than it ever would have gotten on OkCupid, and he has yet to pay anyone a cent.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StuffLifeStyle\" target=\"_blank\">- For more from Life &amp; Style direct to your newsfeed, like us on Facebook.</a></b></p>",

They're calling it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23theshoe&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#TheShoe</a>.</p> <p>People can't agree which colour of nail polish best matches the shoes. Is it the right?</p> <p>But to solve this once and for all,&nbsp;we turned to Photoshop&nbsp;where you can see where the colours of the shoe and the nail polishes fall on the spectrum.</p> <p><img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436476834/869/12180869.jpg\" /></p> <p>Though at first I was in the right polish camp, now I have to admit that the left polish would be the better match since the shoe falls more on the purple scale than the pink colour scale.</p> <p>To prove my point, here's what the right nail polish colour looks like side-by-side with the lightest and the darkest colours on the shoe:<img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436476928/886/12180886.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436476864/876/12180876.jpg\" />And here's what the left nail polish looks like next to the brightest and darkest colours in the shoe. As you can see, these are a much closer match than the bright pink polish:<img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436477053/942/12180942.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1436482662/829/12181829.jpg\" /></p> <p>So if anyone asks, it's the left polish.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StuffLifeStyle\" target=\"_blank\">- For more from Life &amp; Style, head over and like our Facebook page.&nbsp;</a></b></p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WHICH COLOR MATCHES THE SHOES THE BEST <a href=\"http://t.co/Qv3mpOOf8w\">pic.twitter.com/Qv3mpOOf8w</a></p>&mdash; a (@totallymendes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/totallymendes/status/618898681912279041\">July 8, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>",

            "alt_intro": "From long distance love to a dreamy wedding in New York, these Kiwi ladies' wedding was picture perfect. ",
            "body": "<p>Introducing Kirsten Dinnan, 33, and Hannah Dinnan (nee Smith), 32.<br /> <br /> The retail manager and research associate from Palmerston North had many happy years together (although much of that separated by the Cook Strait) before they tied the knot in Central Park.<br /> <br /> From Hannah's beautiful ivory lace dress to Kirsten's superhero statement socks, this beautiful day was equal parts romanticism and whimsy - just perfect.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> We'll let Hannah tell you all about it...&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <b>How did you meet?&nbsp;</b>Kirsten and I were part of a group who became friends after contributing to an online forum. We eventually exchanged phone numbers and I soon fell for Kirsten's quick sense of humour and clever mind. Kirsten was living in Dunedin and I was in Palmerston North, so it was a few months before we actually met when a friend sneakily organised to get Kirsten up to Palmerston North for my birthday. She was delivered to my door covered in wrapping paper and topped off with a bow!<br /> <br /> <b>Tell us about the proposal:&nbsp;</b>Kirsten bought a ring six months after we became a couple and proposed the day after our one year anniversary. We were young and doing long distance, so wedding plans never went beyond daydreams. Over the next eight happy years there were three years of long distance, a &quot;re-proposal&quot; with a second gorgeous engagement ring and a surprise helicopter flight, a first home, a serious car accident and a third (and final) sparkly engagement ring.</p> <p>I have always loved weddings, but found planning ours very overwhelming. We had previously joked about eloping but after Kirsten's accident we decided we didn't want to wait anymore and started planning our New York wedding.</p> <p>Unfortunately our parents couldn't come, but were all very supportive and understanding. However, two of our best friends (Krystal and Sarah) joined us on our adventure which was very special! (Note from my wife Kirsten: &quot;Avoid long engagements if you are marrying a girl who loves sparkly things&quot;).</p> <p><b>Location of wedding:&nbsp;</b>Shakespeare's Garden; a small, beautiful, secluded garden in Central Park, New York City. It was spring, so the garden was full of colour and we got married under a magnificent magnolia tree in bloom while surrounded by tulips and spring flowers.</p> <p><b>Describe your wedding day:&nbsp;</b>Our day started in a helicopter flying around the Statue of Liberty and up the Hudson River. It is such an amazing way to experience New York City.</p> <p>We then headed back to our hotel to meet our lovely hair and make-up artist (Cari Duprey) and her fabulous sidekick. We planned it so Kirsten and Krystal would get ready first and then head up to the hotel's rooftop bar. This meant that Kirsten wouldn't see me all made-up and dressed until I met her on the rooftop for our &quot;first look&quot; photos. After a tequila shot to steady our nerves we walked to the subway station to catch our train to Central Park. It was rush hour so the subway was packed!&nbsp;</p> <p>We met our very sweet celebrant (Judie Guild) at the gardens and after laughter, tears, lovely dinosaurs and zombies we were legally wife and wife.</p> <p>After the ceremony we had photos taken in Central Park before we said goodbye to Amber and hailed a famous yellow cab to take us to dinner. We had dinner at Candle 79, a highly recommended vegan restaurant. I'm the only vegetarian in the group, but the meat eaters all agreed the food was incredible! The restaurant staff were delightful and made such a fuss of us.&nbsp;</p> <p>With full bellies we headed to the Empire State Building to see New York City sparkle at night. It was the perfect way to end our magical day.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The dress:&nbsp;</b>I struggled to find a dress in NZ, so after much agonising I decided to stop stressing about it and find something in New York. Thankfully we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bhldn.com/product/celestina-dress-rose\" target=\"_blank\">BHLDN and I found a gorgeous dress (Celestina).</a> I also found a stunning coat at Macy's to protect me from the springtime weather.</p> <p>My spunky bride wore a shirt that matched her baby blues and one Superman sock and one Batman sock as she couldn't decide on her favourite superhero (she also wore Wonder Woman underwear!).&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The flowers:&nbsp;</b>Tulips were in bloom everywhere in New York, so it seemed fitting to have a bunch as my wedding bouquet. We got them from a small shop in Penn Station on the way back from the helicopter terminal and I tied them with a ribbon from the Tiffany's box that contained my &quot;something new&quot; necklace. My bouquet later became our table centrepiece at dinner.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Highlight of the wedding: </b>It's so hard to pick just one! Kirsten's face when she saw me as her bride for the first time. Saying our vows and declaring &quot;till death or zombies do us part&quot; under a gorgeous magnolia tree. Our first dance (a spontaneous moment dancing to a Beatles song performed by some musicians having a jam session in Central Park). Watching a squirrel unsuccessfully try to bury his nuts in some muddy water behind one of the rocks where we were having our photos taken.</p> <p>Oh, and the laughter (and tears) at dinner while we read letters of congratulations and marriage advice collected from our friends and family before we left New Zealand.</p> <p><b>Was there any drama?&nbsp;</b>Thankfully we had no major dramas beyond our helicopter flight being delayed by an hour which meant we were a bit rushed to make it back to our hotel in time for hair and make-up. Oh, that and wedding shoe blisters!&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The honeymoon:</b> All four of us adventured our way from New York to Washington DC, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Anaheim and finally to Los Angeles. We ate delicious food, saw the sun set over the Grand Canyon, got to be big kids at Disneyland, froze at a Yankees game, explored art galleries and museums, were amazed by Broadway and Cirque du Soleil performances, lost money in Vegas, squealed over squirrels, shopped as much as our baggage limit would allow and made memories for a lifetime.</p> <p><b>Your photographer and favourite photo?</b> We were lucky enough to stumble across our amazing photographer Amber Marlow while researching New York elopements.</p> <p>Her style was exactly what we were after, and she was as wonderful in real life as she was when we were trying to organise everything from afar.</p> <p>My dear wife will say every photo is her favourite, but in particular we love the photos that show the New York skyline and also the one of Kirsten giving me a piggyback off the rocks (I was having difficulty in my heels).</p> <p>I think Amber captured our happiness and delight with each other perfectly.&nbsp;</p>",
